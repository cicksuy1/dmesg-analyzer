## Features

- **Categorizes dmesg output** into Critical, Error, Warning, and Info sections.

- **Interactive terminal UI** for browsing log categories.
- **Supports both live dmesg and log files** as input.
- **Colorful, icon-enhanced output** for quick log scanning.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dmesg-analyzer.git
   cd dmesg-analyzer
   ```

2. **Build with Cargo:**
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

---

## Usage

### Analyze live kernel logs

```sh
cargo run --release
```

### Analyze a saved log file

```sh
cargo run --release -- --file path/to/dmesg.log
```

### Use a custom rules file

```sh
cargo run --release -- --rules path/to/your_rules.toml
```

---

## Rule Configuration

Rules are defined in TOML format. The default is at `rules/default_rules.toml`:

```toml
[error]
keywords = ["error", "fail", "unable"]
color = "red"
icon = "‚ùå"

[warning]
keywords = ["warn", "deprecated", "overcurrent"]
color = "yellow"
icon = "‚ö†Ô∏è"

[critical]
keywords = ["panic", "segfault", "oops"]
color = "bold red"
icon = "üî•"

[info]
keywords = ["usb", "initialized", "found"]
color = "green"
icon = "‚ÑπÔ∏è"
```

- **keywords**: List of substrings to match in log lines.
- **color**: Output color (supported by the [`colored`](https://docs.rs/colored/) crate).
- **icon**: Unicode icon to prefix each line.

## Interactive UI

After parsing, you'll see a menu to select which category to view. Use arrow keys and Enter to select, or Esc to exit. Logs are shown in a colorized pager (`less -R`).
